1. Define input and output directories in settings.py. It could be any directory on PC;
defaults - input and output in this directory.

2. Put desired files in your input dir

3. If you want to enable denoiser, set denoising = True in settings; default - False (denoising disabled)

4. If denoiser is enabled, define sample rate, frame size and quantity of noise frames from the beginning
of your input files.
Keep in mind that time dimension of frame  depends on sample rate AND frame size (e.g. if sample rate is 8000 and
frame size is 1024, length of one frame will be about 0.128 secs)

5. Set desired codec speed mode in settings. Modes 3200, 2400, 1600, 1200, 700 and 500 are available; modes 600 and 450
are deprecated due to poor perfomance - legibility of Russian speech is dramatically low in this modes.

6. Run run.py. It don't need any parameters so simply run it in IDE or 'python run.py' in terminal.



0. Required external libraries are mentioned in requirements.txt. You can install them via
'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

-1. Keep in mind, that for low-speed modes (~especially~ 500) input files need some preprocessing -
at least high-pass filter, because many sounds below certain threshold are corrupted. But HPF could damage
input signal too, so maybe certain recording conditions could be the solution.
TODO: Implement such a HPF to preprocess samples in low-speed modes

-2. Project was built and tested on macOS and Linux, so it most likely does not work on Windows.
